# Rule-Based-Classification-2
# Business Problem
- A game company wants to create level-based new customer personas using certain characteristics of their customers and 
 estimate how much revenue potential new customers from these segments could bring to the company.
- For example, the company wants to determine how much revenue a 25-year-old male user from Turkey, who uses iOS, can 
 potentially generate on average.
 # Data Set Story
- The "persona.csv" dataset contains the prices of products sold by an international game company and includes some 
 demographic information about the users who purchased these products. The dataset consists of records generated from 
 each sales transaction. This means that the table is not de-duplicated. In other words, a user with specific demographic 
 characteristics may have made multiple purchases.
- price: The amount spent by the customer.
- source: The type of device the customer is connected to.
- sex: The gender of the customer.
- country: The country of the customer.
- age: The age of the customer.
